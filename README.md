# Smart-suit-for-Visuallly-impaired-people
An IoT-enabled smart suit for blind people is a wearable technology designed to enhance
the independence, mobility, and safety of individuals with visual impairments.This innovative technology will use a combination of sensors,mobile vibrators to provide real-time information about the wearerâ€™s surroundings. Here are some of the key needs that this technology can address:
- Navigation: Visually impaired individuals often have difficulty navigating their environment independently, which can limit their mobility and ability to participate in
activities. An IoT smart suit with distance sensors can detect obstacles and provide
haptic feedback to the wearer, helping them to navigate more safely and confidently.
- Communication: The mobile vibrator and WiFi module can be used to communicate with the wearer in real-time, providing updates on the surrounding environment
or alerts for potential hazards.
- Independence: By providing real-time feedback and communication, the IoT smart
suit can enable visually impaired individuals to be more independent in their daily
activities, reducing the need for a sighted guide or assistant.
- Safety: The distance sensors and haptic feedback can help prevent accidents and
injuries caused by obstacles or hazards that the wearer may not be able to see.

Overall, an IoT enabled smart suit with distance sensors, a mobile vibrator, and a WiFi
module has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for visually impaired
individuals, enabling them to navigate their environment with greater confidence and independence.
